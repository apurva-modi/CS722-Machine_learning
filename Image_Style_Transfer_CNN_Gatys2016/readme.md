# **Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks by Gatys et al. (2016)**
##  Members: Apurva Modi, Maruf Sakib, Lalita Sharkey

This is a semester project for CS772. The instruction of this project is implementing selected
algorithms from a recent publication. 

### Requirement:
* Google Calab (Python 3)
* Jupyter Notebook/ Python Notebook (Python 3)
  Additional packages need to be installed
  * TensorFlow
  * PIL
  * functools
  * numpy

### Notes:
* Our team decided to use Google Calab to implement Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks according to the method proposed by Gatys et al., (2016). **The code should already be executed and ready for anyone to observe.**
* If your are running the notebook on your local machine: 
	* Download the notebook to your machine
	* Make sure that the path to content image and syle image are correct.  
	* Run all cells to observe the result
